Subprocess services will escape spaces in command array:

For all subprocess services (`AdbNoneProtocolSubprocessService.prototype.spawn`, `AdbNoneProtocolSubprocessService.prototype.pty`, `AdbShellProtocolSubprocessService.prototype.spawn` and `AdbShellProtocolSubprocessService.prototype.pty`), when the command is given in an array, all unescaped space characters in each argument will be escaped with a backslash (`\`), ensuring the argument list is preserved on device side.

This is a breaking change because you can't pass multiple arguments in a single string in the command array (which you shouldn't anyway).

Note that you should still use `escapeArg` if an argument contains user input. You can only omit it when an argument is generated by your code.
