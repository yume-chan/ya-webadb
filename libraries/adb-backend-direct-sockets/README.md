# `@yume-chan/adb-backend-direct-sockets`

Use [Direct Sockets API](https://wicg.github.io/direct-sockets/) for plugin-free ADB over WiFi connection.

Note: Direct Sockets API is still under development in Chrome and requires extra command line arguments to enable. This package is not intended to be used in production, thus not published to NPM registry.
